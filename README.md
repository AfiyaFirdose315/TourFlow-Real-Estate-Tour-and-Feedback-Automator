#Real Estate Tour & Feedback Automator

#Project Overview

The Real Estate Tour & Feedback Automator is a comprehensive solution built on the Salesforce platform to streamline and automate the entire tour lifecycle. It transforms a manual, error-prone process into a data-driven and highly efficient workflow, allowing real estate agents to focus on client relationships, not administrative tasks.
The project is designed to be a learning tool for Salesforce administrators and developers, showcasing the power of combining low-code automation (Salesforce Flow) with modern custom development (Lightning Web Components).

#Key Features

Automated Communication: The system automatically sends email reminders to clients two days before a tour and a final confirmation on the day of the tour.
Automated Feedback Collection: After each tour, the system automatically sends a follow-up email to collect valuable client feedback.
Intuitive User Interface: The user experience is enhanced with custom-built Lightning Web Components (LWC), providing an attractive, modern, and interactive interface.
Data-Driven Insights: All tour data and client feedback are saved directly in Salesforce, providing agents with a single source of truth to track client preferences and improve their sales strategy.

#Technologies Used

Salesforce Platform: The core business application platform.
Salesforce Flow: The low-code automation tool used to create all the business logic, including email reminders and data updates.
Lightning Web Components (LWC): The modern JavaScript framework used to build custom UI components like the Tour Calendar and Dashboard.
Apex: Salesforce's backend programming language, used to retrieve and save data for the LWC components.
