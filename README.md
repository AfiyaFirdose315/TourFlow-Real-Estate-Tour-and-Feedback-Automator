#Real Estate Tour & Feedback Automator

#Project Overview

The Real Estate Tour & Feedback Automator is a comprehensive solution built on the Salesforce platform to streamline and automate the entire tour lifecycle. It transforms a manual, error-prone process into a data-driven and highly efficient workflow, allowing real estate agents to focus on client relationships, not administrative tasks.

#Key Features

Automated Communication: The system automatically sends email reminders to clients two days before a tour and a final confirmation on the day of the tour.

Automated Feedback Collection: After each tour, the system automatically sends a follow-up email to collect valuable client feedback.

Intuitive User Interface: The user experience is enhanced with custom-built Lightning Web Components (LWC), providing an attractive, modern, and interactive interface.

Data-Driven Insights: All tour data and client feedback are saved directly in Salesforce, providing agents with a single source of truth to track client preferences and improve their sales strategy.

#Technologies Used

Salesforce Platform: The core business application platform.

Salesforce Flow: The low-code automation tool used to create all the business logic, including email reminders and data updates.

Apex: Salesforce's backend programming language, used to retrieve and save data for the LWC components.
